# Mitigating Polarization in Online Discussions Through Adaptive Moderation Techniques

This thesis aims to develop and assess strategies to reduce polarisation within online discussions by implementing adaptive moderation techniques. The focus will be on identifying key factors that contribute to polarisation in digital forums—such as echo chambers and filter bubbles—and exploring how moderation strategies can be dynamically adjusted to encourage more balanced and inclusive discussions. The research will involve designing algorithms that can detect early signs of polarization and intervene with tailored responses, such as promoting diverse viewpoints, suggesting consensus-building comments, or altering discussion structures. The effectiveness of these adaptive strategies will be evaluated through a series of controlled experiments within online discussion environments, using primarily synthetic data. Expected outcomes include a set of best practices for digital moderators and the development of an AI-based moderation tool that can automatically adapt its responses based on the evolving dynamics of a discussion. This study seeks to offer valuable insights into the mechanics of discussion polarisation and provide practical tools to enhance discourse quality on digital platforms.
