And\njust because something doesn't fit your narrow-minded view of the\nworld doesn't mean it's unnatural or against God's plan. You're not\nGod, and neither is anyone else on this planet. As for there only\nbeing two genders, that's simply not true. Gender identity is a\nspectrum, and people have been expressing themselves in ways that\ndon't fit traditional gender norms for centuries. Get over yourself\nand try to educate yourself instead of spreading hate and\nmisinformation."
